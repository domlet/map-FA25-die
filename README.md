## What did I build?

["Run of my memories" App](https://diegol32p1.github.io/my-first-map-/)  is a one-page, mobile-friendly web app that offers interactive maps for five cycling routes in the SF Bay Area. 

Users can...
1. **Explore the map**, by clicking on the map and moving the mouse to go where you want. 
1. **Explore the map** by using gestures to zoom in/out anywhere, rotate the map orientation, or change the pitch (angle).

Here's a demo:

## Why did I build this?

I built this because I wanted to show the places that meant something to me, also the places I would go to relax. 


## Tech stack

To build this app, I used the following tools:

1. [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides) library, for styling and displaying maps.
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) free IDE, with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) extensions.
3. [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site), for publishing the app for free!
